Project Source
==============

Project source is my first text-adventure game. I have recently gotten into the programming language JavaScript and have found game design as something I really admire. So I took it upon myself to study up and make my first game. Now Project Source will get an official name but for now its under Source. My plans for this game is to get it up on the web so people can get it out and in the future to release a base for people to edit and make their own text adventure game.
