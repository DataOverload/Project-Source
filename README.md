Project Source
==============

Project source is my first text-adventure game. I have recently gotten into the programming language JavaScript and have found game design as something I really admire. So I took it upon myself to study up and make my first game. Now Project Source will get an official name but for now its under Source. My plans for this game is to get it up on the web so people can get it out and in the future to release a base for people to edit and make their own text adventure game.

Booting up Project Source
===================================
Step 1:
---------
      Download project source from the git.
Step 2:
---------
      Un-Zip the file from the file location.
Step 3:
--------
      Double click on the index.html file and the game will boot right up!

Disclaimer:
==========
At this moment project source is in rough alpha so things like commands won't work or the program might not boot up. If this happens then please do email me and i'll see what the problem is. As I said before i'm pretty new to game design in JavaScript so things might be a little rough around the edges. But it's getting there. One last thing, Project Souce is a placeholder name before the actual product name is released.
