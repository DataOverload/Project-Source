CheckList:

1. I need to figure out how to make a interactive map, I can make some mock-ups to show you later ashie if you can't visualized what I'm talking about. 

2. Need to escape() the input.(basically sanitize it so people can't execute their own code inside my document)

3.Need to work out an official name for the game.

4. Work out a system for beta testing. Something like Access codes where only certain people can access the page.

5. Lastly if we can do this, make a username & password system where people can share the game out.
